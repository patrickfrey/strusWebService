- create parameters in /index/create are ignored
- parameters are not persistent between sessions
- can't ommit the "params" member in JSON /index/create request
- no loadable database implementation support
- can't implement a /document/exists
- attribute pairs are string/string for now, we also want other
  value types like ints/doubles too
- insert doc doesn't handle ACLs at the moment
- typedefs in template function for serialization instead of
  std::pair and boost::tuple directly?
- report "number of documents affected" like a database on
  insert, update, delete?
- quite some copy-paste-code around parsing JSON request,
  must find an elegant solution, no answer structs exist, 
  JSON is mapped directly
  something with templates forming a protocol request and
  answer mapping with parameters of some sort
- JSON exception throw instead of clear indication of error
  location in the tree. This is a cppcms thing I'm afraid.
- transactions work only per index, but in theory there is
  no problem to implement them to span more than one index
- can we pass 0 to createErrorBuffer_standard and still get
  all errors? do we get rid of the funny behaviour of reappearing
  error messages this way?
- transfering big payloads (e.g. abstracts in ranklist) leads
  to 100 CPU usage and a blocked server
