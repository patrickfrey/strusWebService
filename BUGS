- create parameters in /index/create are ignored
- parameters are not persistent between sessions
- can't ommit the "params" member in JSON /index/create request
- no loadable database implementation support
- can't implement a /document/exists
- attribute pairs are string/string for now, we also want other
  value types like ints/doubles too
